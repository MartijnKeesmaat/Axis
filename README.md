## Boilerplate
The Boilerplate is used to get started as fast as possible and to be customized with ease.
Text, form and more elements are already styled and can easily be changed with variables.
Variables are also used for colours, and there are shadows and transitions to get faster started.

### Styles are divided in 4 categories
1. **Utilities**, All the extern files go in this folder, from the start it has normalize.css

2. **Settings**, Variables and mixins go here for  now the mixins are used for the media querries.

3. **Base**, All the standard html elements get styled here.

4. **Components**, Every individual component gets a seperate file. An example of a component can be a modal or a slider.

## Expanded
Easily expanded with more advanced components.
