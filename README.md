#Axis

Axis is a way to get quickly started with a well thought out **structure** for every front-end project. It strives to create projects with beautifully organized code, this is achieved by adapting the **BEM** methodology and using a **SMACSS** inspired structure. With this approach Axis is ready to face small, large and long lasting projects.
