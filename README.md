Axis is a component-driven boilerplate, which can be extended to a framework. It strives to create projects with beautifully organized code, this is achieved by adapting the BEM methodology and using a SMACSS inspired structure. With this approach you can create modular and scaleable front-end environment. 


<br>


## Quick start
Get your front-end environment up and running in 3 simple steps.

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Run ```npm install``` in the root folder
3. Run ```gulp```


<br>

## Core elements 
When downloaded you start out with the "core". <br>
This exist out of the styling of the [basic elements](https://martijnkeesmaat.github.io/components.html), like typhography, buttons, forms and more.

<br>


## Components
Axis has a various amount of pre-build components to develop at a faster rate. <br>
You choose which elements you want, so that you only get the elements you actually use.
