# Starterkit
The Starterkit is a basic boilerplate equipped with alot of useful tools to start your project. 
The goal is to have a solid beginning and than expand it with components.

## Boilerplate
The Boilerplate is used to get started as fast as possible and to be customized with ease.
Text, form and more elements are already styled and can easily be changed with variables.
Variables are also used for colours, and there are shadows and transitions to get faster started.

### Styles are divided in 4 categories
#### Utilities
All the extern files go in this folder, from the start it has normalize.css

#### Base
